    "### Note on  Streaming\n",
    "Streaming is something that is rapidly advancing and changin fast, there are multipl enew libraries every year, new and different services always popping up, and what is in this notebook may or may not apply to you. Maybe your looking for something specific on Kafka, or maybe you are looking for streaming about twitter, in which case Spark might be overkill for what you really want. Realistically speaking each situation is going to require a customized solution and this course is never going to be able to supply a one size fits all solution. Because of this, I wanted to point out some great resources for Python and Spark StreamingL\n",

You don't access to the entire \"firehose\" of twitter without paying for it, but that would be too much for us to handle anyway, so we'll be more than fine with the freely available API access.\n",

    "Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark’s machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.\n",
